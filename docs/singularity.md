## What is Singularity?

## Tell me more

# Setup

This tutorial depends on files from the course Bitbucket repo. Take a look at the [intro](tutorial_intro.md) for instructions on how to set it up if you haven't done so already. Then open up a terminal and go to `reproducible_research_course/docker`.

## Install Singularity

### macOS

Download the Singularity Desktop DMG file from [here](https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/) and follow the instructions.
You can test the installation by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
singularity run library://godlovedc/funny/lolcow
```

### Linux

Follow the instructions [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.4/user-guide/installation.html#distribution-packages-of-singularity).

### Windows

Installing on Windows may be tricky. This requires running Singularity through a Vagrant Box. See [instructions here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.4/user-guide/installation.html#install-on-windows-or-mac).
