# Finding the course venue

1. Transport yourself to Stockholm (see e.g. [SJ](https://www.sj.se) or [MTR Express](https://www.mtrexpress.se)).
2. Go to SciLifeLab in Solna ([Tomtebodav√§gen 23A, 171 65 Solna](https://goo.gl/maps/NsTFHxfAYcr)). The closest bus stop is called Karolinska institutet Biomedicum (search for public transport options [here](https://sl.se/en/)).
3. Enter the SciLifeLab/Karolinska Institutet Science Park building. After entering, turn immediately left and pass through the glass door to find the room Air, where to course will take place. (There is a reception where you can ask for help if you cannot find the rooms.)

# Finding the restaurant for the course dinner
We will have the course dinner at [Grappa Bar och Matsal](http://www.grappabar.nu/kontakt.aspx). It is located on Sankt Eriksgatan 86, close to Sankt Eriksplan.
