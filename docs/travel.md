# Finding the course venue

1. Transport yourself to Stockholm (see *e.g.* [SJ's
   website](https://www.sj.se/#/)).

2. Go to SciLifeLab in Solna ([Tomtebodav√§gen 23A, 171 65
   Solna](https://goo.gl/maps/YhWgJPt44qfTe1ad9)). The closest bus stop is
   called Karolinska institutet Biomedicum (search for public transport options
   [here](https://sl.se/)).

3. Enter the SciLifeLab/Karolinska Institutet Science Park building. After
   entering, turn immediately left and pass through the glass door to find the
   rooms Air and Fire, where to course will take place. (There is a reception
   where you can ask for help if you cannot find the rooms.)
