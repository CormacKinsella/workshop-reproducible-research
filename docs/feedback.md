# Tools for Reproducible Research

!!! attention
    If you're viewing this page from the course documentation at Read the Docs, then you won't be able to add questions/feedback nor see the live updates
    to the document. To edit go to the [document at HackMD](https://hackmd.io/4hSZFZdiROGOq8ZtiAvMUw).

This is a collaborative document where you can give feedback, ask questions and receive help from both TAs and other students. The idea is that it will complement the Zoom breakout rooms and allow you to get more rapid help with common questions and issues.

We've created headers for each day to keep things organised. Simply write your questions and comments under the respective day.

## How to edit

Simply click the `Edit` button in the top menu to get started. You can view the document in split Markdown, Markdown/Preview or Preview modes.
