The *Reproducibility project* set out to replicate 100 experiments published in
high-impact psychology journals. ^[*"Estimating the reproducibility of
psychological science". Science. 349*]

About one-half to two-thirds of the original findings could not be observed in
the replication study.

Medicine is among the most affected research fields. A study in Nature found
that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were
irreproducible.^[*"Raise standards for preclinical cancer research. Nature, 483(7391), 531-533.*]

## Reproducibility is rarer than you think

The results of only 26% out of 204 randomly selected papers in the journal
*Science* could be reproduced. ^[*"An empirical analysis
of journal policy effectiveness for computational reproducibility". PNAS. 115
(11): 2584-2589*]

## How are you handling your [data]{.green}? {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- Data available on request
- All metadata required for generating the results available
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- Raw data deposited in public repositories
- If the raw data needed preprocessing, scripts were used rather than modifying
  it manually
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Section in the paper or online repository (_e.g._ GitHub) to aid in
  reproduction
- Used non-proprietary and machine-readable formats, *e.g.* `.csv` rather than
  `.xls`.
:::

::: {.aside}
*If you want to learn more about data management in-depth, NBIS has a course for
you: [Introduction to Data Management Practices]{.green}*
:::

## How are you handling your [code]{.green}? {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- All code for generating results from processed data available on request
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- All code for generating results from raw data is available
- The code is publicly available with timestamps or tags
:::


::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Code is documented and contains instructions for reproducing results
- Seeds were used and documented for heuristic methods
:::

## How are you handling your [environment]{.green}? {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
[Decent:]{.light-grey}

- Key programs used are mentioned in the _materials and methods_ section
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Good:]{.light-grey}

- List of all programs used and their respective versions are available
:::

::: {.fragment}
[Great:]{.light-grey}

- Instructions for reproducing the whole environment publicly available
:::

## "What's in it for me?" {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
[Before]{.green} the project:

- Improved structure and organization
- Forced to think about scope and limitations
:::

::: {.fragment}
[During]{.green} the project:

- Easier to re-run analyses and generate results after updates and/or changes
- Closer interaction between collaborators
- Much of the manuscript "writes itself"
:::


::: {.fragment}
[After]{.green} the project:

- Faster resumption of research by others (or, more likely, your future self)
- Increased visibility in the scientific community
