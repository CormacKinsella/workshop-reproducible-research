# Differences between Snakemake and Nextflow

<br>

```{r Snakemake vs. Nextflow table, echo = FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("kableExtra")
data <- data.frame(Snakemake = c("Python",
                                 "Everything is a file",
                                 "Working directory",
                                 "\"Pull\"",
                                 "Yes",
                                 "No"),
                   Nextflow = c("Groovy",
                                "Can use both files and values",
                                "Each job in its own directory",
                                "\"Push\"",
                                "No",
                                "Yes"))
row.names(data) <- c("Language",
                     "Data",
                     "Execution",
                     "Philosophy",

* .green[Question]: But, which one is the *best?*

* .green[Answer]: Both - it's mostly up to personal preference!

# Anatomy of a Nextflow workflow

```groovy
workflow {

    // Define SRA input data channel
    Channel
        .fromList ( ["SRR935090", "SRR935091", "SRR935092"] )
        .set      { ch_sra_ids }

    // Define the workflow
    GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION (
        ch_sra_ids
    )
    RUN_FASTQC (
        GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION.out
    )
    RUN_MULTIQC (
        RUN_FASTQC.out.collect()
    )
}
```

--

```groovy
process GET_SRA_BY_ACCESSION {

    input:
    val(sra_id)

    output:
    tuple val(sra_id), path("${sra_id}.fastq.gz")

    script:
    """
    fastq-dump ${sra_id} > ${sra_id}.fastq.gz
    """
}
```

--

```bash
$ nextflow run main.nf
```

# The aims of this tutorial

--

* Give a brief .green[overview] of how Nextflow works through a recreation of
  the MRSA Snakemake workflow

--

* Show .green[similarities] and .green[differences] between Snakemake and
  Nextflow

--

* Give you an opportunity to .green[try out both] Snakemake and Nextflow

--

* The Nextflow tutorial is shorter and less in-depth compared to the Snakemake
  tutorial, given these aims
