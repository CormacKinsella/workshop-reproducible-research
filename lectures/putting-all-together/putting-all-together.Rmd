# What have we learned?

* How to use the version control system .green[Git] to track changes to code

--

* How to use the package and environment manager .green[Conda]

--

* How to use the workflow manager .green[Snakemake]

--

* How to use .green[RMarkdown] to generate automated reports

* How to use .green[Jupyter] notebooks to document your analysis

--

* How to use .green[Docker] and .green[Singularity] to distribute containerized
  computational environments

# Options for reproducing a project

Everything can be a project

* Divide your work into .green[distinct projects]

--

* Keep all files needed to go .green[from raw data to final results] in a dedicated directory

--

* Use .green[relevant subdirectories]

--

* Many software support the “project way of working”, e.g. .green[Rstudio] and the text editors .green[Sublime Text] and .green[Atom]
