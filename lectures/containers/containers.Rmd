# Docker vs. Singularity

| Docker | Singularity |
| ------ | ----------- |
| runs as a daemon process with superuser privileges | runs as regular user |
| images stored centrally | image files that you can move around. No layers! |
| isolates the host and container file system by default | containers have access to host file system |
| well supported on Mac/Linux/Windows | limited support on Mac/Windows |
| closed source community driven | open source community driven |
