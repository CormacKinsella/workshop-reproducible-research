# What is Git?

--

* A system for distributed .green[version control]

--

* Keeps a .green[complete history] the changes you make to your files

--

* Each point in the history can be re-visited and compared with others

--

* Git tracks .green[who contributed what] to your code

--

* Git can help you .green[version, backup and share] your code and documents

---

# Git nomenclature

--

* A .green[repository] is a collection that encompasses all the files and
  directories of a project

--

* A .green[commit] is a snapshot of a repository's history, *i.e.* a point
  in development time

--

* Development can be separated into .green[branches], allowing for concurrent
  work on the same repository with simple transitions between functional and
  work-in-progress code

--

* Uploading changes to a remote repository is called .green[pushing], while
  downloading changes is called .green[pulling]
