Singularity is a container software alternative to Docker. It was originally
developed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with focus on
security, scientific software, and HPC clusters. One of the ways in which
Singularity is more suitable for HPC is that it very actively restricts
permissions so that you do not gain access to additional resources while inside
the container.

This tutorial depends on files from the course GitHub repo. Take a look at
the [setup](pre-course-setup) for instructions on how to set it up if you
haven't done so already. Then open up a terminal and go to
`workshop-reproducible-research/singularity`.
