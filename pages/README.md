# Uploading pages to Canvas

The `upload-page-to-canvas.sh` bash script can be used to upload or update
pages on Canvas. Usage is simple, for example:

```bash
./upload-age-to-canvas.sh conda/conda-1-introduction.md
```

This will either upload or update the `conda-1-introduction.md` page to Canvas,
as applicable, using the default parameters as specified in the script. Things
you may want to change include the `COURSE_ID` parameter and the maximum width
of the resulting page.
