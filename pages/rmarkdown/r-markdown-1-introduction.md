The *R Markdown* format (usually `.rmd` or `.Rmd`) is a multi-functional format,
especially for scientific coding and analyses. R Markdown documents can be used
both to save and execute code as well as generating reports in various output
formats. This is done by mixing *markdown* and so-called *code chunks* in the
same document; we also have [course materials for markdown](markdown). The code
itself, as well as the output it generates, can be included in the final report.

R Markdown makes your analysis more reproducible by connecting your code,
figures and descriptive text. You can use it to make reproducible reports,
rather than *e.g.* copy-pasting figures into a Word document. You can also use
it as a notebook, in the same way as lab notebooks are used in a wet lab
setting (or as we utilise *Jupyter notebooks* in the tutorial after this one).

This tutorial depends on files from the course GitHub repo. Take a look at the
[setup](pre-course-setup) for instructions on how to set it up if you haven't
done so already. Place yourself in the `workshop-reproducible-research/tutorials/rmarkdown/`
directory, activate your `rmarkdown-env` Conda environment and start RStudio
from the command line (type `rstudio &`).
