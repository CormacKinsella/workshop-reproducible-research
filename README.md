This repo contains files used in the tutorials in the NBIS / ELIXIR *Tools for
Reproducible Research* course. The course itself lives in [Canvas](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses),
where you can find all the relevant information.

If you are a student, you are most likely looking for the `tutorials/`
directory: this is where all the material you will need to go through the
course content is situated. You may also want to look at the non-rendered
lectures, which you can find in the `lectures/` directory.
