# Tools for Reproducible Research

This repo contains files used in the tutorials in the NBIS / ELIXIR *Tools for
Reproducible Research course*. The course itself lives in [Canvas](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/51980),
where you can find all the relevant information.

If you are a student, you are most likely looking for the `tutorials/`
directory: this is where all the material you will need to go through the course
content is situated. You may also want to look at the non-rendered lectures,
which you can find in the `lectures/` directory.
