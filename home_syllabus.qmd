## Entry requirements

This is an NBIS / Elixir course. The course is open for PhD students, postdocs,
group leaders and core facility staff. International applications are welcome,
but we will give approximately half of the participant slots to applicants from
Swedish universities, due to the national role NBIS plays in Sweden.

The only entry requirements for this course is a basic knowledge of Unix systems
(i.e. being able to work on the command line) as well as at least a basic
knowledge of either R or Python.

Due to limited space the course can accommodate maximum of 20 participants. If
we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several
criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to
attend the course as well as gender and geographical balance.

Please note that NBIS training events do not provide any formal university
credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of
credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits
are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before
submitting a course application in order to establish whether the course is
valid for formal credits or not.

## Code of Conduct

By accepting to participate in the course, you agree to follow the NBIS Training
Code of Conduct.

Training is one of the core values of NBIS, and benefits from the contributions
of the entire scientific community. We value the involvement of everyone in the
community. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for
learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our events and
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in NBIS/ELIXIR courses is

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all

participants accept to abide by the NBIS Code of Conduct and accept the
procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of
behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code

events:

 - Use welcoming and inclusive language
